backupCheck:

This runs storeBackupCheckBackup, but redirects the output to a timestamped file.


fixbadfiles.py:

Sometimes there is a bit error when copying files to the backup. storeBackupCheckBackup
will list these problem files in its output. This program parses that output (which you
have stored in a file), and copies them again from the source.
